# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to use this to make a page in GitHub using Jekyll. Though first I'm going to practice some Markdown.

I'll do that first by quoting the great William Shakespeare:
>There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.

Then I'm going to make a list of Jane Austen books.
*Pride and Prejudice 
*Emma
*Lady Susan 
*Sense and Sensibility

Then I'm going to make a numbered list of my favorite popcorn flavors
1.Salt and vinegar
2.Butter
3.Kettle Corn

Next I will practice a nested list by pairing a type of wine with each popcorn
1.Salt and vinegar
  -None. No wine pairs with vinegar. Try some beer. Anything will do.
2.Butter
  -Merlot
3.Kettle Corn
  -Ros√©
  
How about a to-do list? We all love those right?
-[] Heck yeah we do
-[] Nope Nope Nope
-[] Yeah?
-[X] What did he say he was selling?

Well that's not really a to-do list, but it will do. Right?
